      <h1>Seattle</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">The first day after we arrived in Seattle, we woke up super early, because we were all jetlagged. We went to a local breakfast place called The 5 Point Café. After that we went to the space needle which was like 5 minutes away. The queue to buy a ticket was super long, but luckily, we had already bought tickets online, but the queue to get up was still long. The space needle has second floors, the top floor has the balcony, but the first floor has a revolving floor, so you can just sit there and experience the view. After that we went back to the hotel because we were tired. The second day in Seattle we went to the farmers market, there were a lot of cool shops there but the coolest must have been the first ever Starbucks there, we spent a few hours just locking around in there. After that we went to Fly Over Seattle, it’s kind of like a roller coaster where it feels like you’re flying over Seattle. On the third day we left for Leavenworth.</p>
      
      <h1>Leavenworth</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">On our way to Leavenworth, we stopped for a hike on Heybrook Ridge Trailhead. When we arrived in Leavenworth it was already late, so we just got something to eat and then went to bed. On our first day in Leavenworth we explored the town, the town has a very German look to it. And has a lot of German style shops. After exploring the town, we went mini golfing for 2 hours, before going back to town to eat dinner. On the second day in Leavenworth, we left for Osoyoos.</p>
      
      <h1>Osoyoos</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">Before arriving in Osoyoos, we stopped by a swimming park, where they had the world’s biggest surfing machine. After we had been there for a few hours we drove to the border of Canada and then from there to Osoyoos. When we arrived in Osoyoos we explored the town before going down to the beach to see the fireworks. We only stayed there a night before leaving for Vernon.</p>

      <h1>Vernon</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">When we arrived in Vernon it was late, so we just made dinner and then went to bed. The first day there we went to play tennis at a local tennis court, not to brag but I won all the games we played. After we had played tennis, we went down to the pool where we relaxed for a few hours before going back to make dinner. There were a lot of wild animals roaming around the place, we even saw a deer right outside our home. On the second day we went to Kalamalka Lake where we spent a few hours. After we had taken a nice bath in the lake, we went into town explore and eat. The next day we left early for rocky mountain national park.</p>

      <h1>Golden</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">Emerald Lake</p>

      <h1>Banff</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">We arrived in Banff very late, we had to go to bed immediately. Unfortunately, I felt a bit ill when we were in Banff, but I still managed to explore the city and get some food before going back to the apartment. Later that day we vent out for dinner, but couldn’t find anywhere to eat, and with me being sick and everyone else a bit hangry the dinner wasn’t as good. On the second day we left for Calgary, but before we made it out of Banff we stopped by the upper hot springs. The hot springs were very relaxing before the drive to Calgary.</p>
      
      <h1>Calgary </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">When we arrived in Calgary we went out for dinner at a place where we could watch the football match between Argentina and Canada in the semifinals. After dinner we went for a walk down Bow River and then went home. The apartment we stayed at gave us access to a gym which my brother and I used before going to bed. On our first day in Calgary, we went to the Calgary Stampede. We first walked around outside and checked about a lot of the stuff there. There was everything from military vehicles to teepees, but it eventually got way too hot. We went into the big market inside to just look around. I eventually found something I liked, a sword from a show I watch. There were a lot of shows that were showing there, we went to the Tie-Down Roping show, which was very fun to watch, but we had to leave halfway throe the show because we had tickets to the Rodeo. The Rodeo was very overwhelming, there was a lot going on at every moment. It didn’t make it better because there was a kid behind us that was screaming all the time. Other than that, it was ok, I would personally not go watch it again, but it was still worth it to watch it at least once. We did leave halfway through it because it was just too much. When we left it was </p>
