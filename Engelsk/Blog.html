      <h1>Seattle</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">The first day after we arrived in Seattle, we woke up super early because we were all jetlagged. We went to a local breakfast place called The 5 Point Café. After that, we went to the Space Needle, which was about five minutes away. The queue to buy a ticket was super long, but luckily, we had already bought tickets online. However, the queue to get up was still long. The Space Needle has two floors; the top floor has a balcony, while the first floor has a revolving floor, so you can just sit there and experience the view. After that, we went back to the hotel because we were tired. On the second day in Seattle, we went to the farmers' market. There were a lot of cool shops there, but the coolest must have been the first-ever Starbucks; we spent a few hours just looking around in there. After that, we went to Flyover Seattle, which is kind of like a roller coaster where it feels like you’re flying over the city. On the third day, we left for Leavenworth.</p>
      
      <h1>Leavenworth</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">On our way to Leavenworth, we stopped for a hike on Heybrook Ridge Trailhead. When we arrived in Leavenworth it was already late, so we just got something to eat and then went to bed. On our first day in Leavenworth we explored the town, the town has a very German look to it. And has a lot of German style shops. After exploring the town, we went mini golfing for 2 hours, before going back to town to eat dinner. On the second day in Leavenworth, we left for Osoyoos.</p>

      <h1>Osoyoos</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">Before arriving in Osoyoos, we stopped by a swimming park where they had the world’s biggest surfing machine. After we had been there for a few hours, we drove to the border of Canada and then from there to Osoyoos. When we arrived, we explored the town before going down to the beach to see the fireworks. We only stayed there for a night before leaving for Vernon.</p>

      <h1>Vernon</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">When we arrived in Vernon, it was late, so we just made dinner and then went to bed. On the first day there, we played tennis at a local court. Not to brag, but I won all the games we played. After playing tennis, we went down to the pool where we relaxed for a few hours before going back to make dinner. There were a lot of wild animals roaming around the place; we even saw a deer right outside our home. On the second day, we went to Kalamalka Lake, where we spent a few hours. After taking a nice bath in the lake, we went into town to explore and eat. The next day, we left early for Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>

      <h1>Golden</h1>

      <h1>Banff</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">We arrived in Banff very late and had to go to bed immediately. Unfortunately, I felt a bit ill while we were there, but I still managed to explore the city and get some food before returning to the apartment. Later that day, we went out for dinner but couldn’t find anywhere to eat. With me being sick and everyone else a bit hangry, dinner wasn’t as good. On the second day, we left for Calgary, but before making it out of Banff, we stopped by the Upper Hot Springs. The hot springs were very relaxing before the drive to Calgary.</p>
      
      <h1>Calgary </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">When we arrived in Calgary, we went out for dinner at a place where we could watch the football match between Argentina and Canada in the semifinals. After dinner, we walked down Bow River and then went home. The apartment we stayed at gave us access to a gym, which my brother and I used before going to bed. On our first day in Calgary, we went to the Calgary Stampede. We first walked around outside and checked out a lot of the exhibits there. There was everything from military vehicles to teepees, but it eventually got way too hot. We went into the big market inside to look around. I eventually found something I liked: a sword from a show I watch. There were a lot of shows happening there; we went to the Tie-Down Roping show, which was very fun to watch, but we had to leave halfway through the show because we had tickets to the rodeo. The rodeo was very overwhelming; there was a lot going on at every moment. It didn’t help that there was a kid behind us screaming all the time. Other than that, it was okay. I personally would not go to watch it again, but it was still worth it to see at least once. We left halfway through because it was just too much.</p>
