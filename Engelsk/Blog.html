        The first day after we arrived in Seattle, we woke up super early because we were all jetlagged. We went to a local breakfast place called The 5 Point Café. After that, we went to the Space Needle, which was about five minutes away. The queue to buy a ticket was super long, but luckily, we had already bought tickets online. However, the queue to get up was still long. The Space Needle has two floors; the top floor has a balcony, while the first floor has a revolving floor, so you can just sit there and experience the view. After that, we went back to the hotel because we were tired. On the second day in Seattle, we went to the farmers' market. There were a lot of cool shops there, but the coolest must have been the first-ever Starbucks; we spent a few hours just looking around in there. After that, we went to Flyover Seattle, which is kind of like a roller coaster where it feels like you’re flying over the city. On the third day, we left for Leavenworth.      </p>

        On our way to Leavenworth, we stopped for a hike at Heybrook Ridge Trailhead. When we arrived in Leavenworth, it was already late, so we just got something to eat and then went to bed. On our first day in Leavenworth, we explored the town. It has a very German look and features many German-style shops. After exploring the town, we went mini golfing for two hours before returning to town for dinner. On the second day in Leavenworth, we left for Osoyoos.      </p>

        Before arriving in Osoyoos, we stopped by a swimming park where they had the world’s biggest surfing machine. After we had been there for a few hours, we drove to the border of Canada and then from there to Osoyoos. When we arrived, we explored the town before going down to the beach to see the fireworks. We only stayed there for a night before leaving for Vernon.      </p>

        When we arrived in Vernon, it was late, so we just made dinner and then went to bed. On the first day there, we played tennis at a local court. Not to brag, but I won all the games we played. After playing tennis, we went down to the pool where we relaxed for a few hours before going back to make dinner. There were a lot of wild animals roaming around the place; we even saw a deer right outside our home. On the second day, we went to Kalamalka Lake, where we spent a few hours. After taking a nice bath in the lake, we went into town to explore and eat. The next day, we left early for Rocky Mountain National Park.

        After staying the night in Golden, we drove to Emerald Lake, which was a beautiful lake. The water was so emerald-like in color. We didn’t spend a lot of time here as we had two other lakes to look at. It was a bit of a drive to the next lake; we had to drive to a ski resort and then take a bus to Moraine Lake. I haven’t seen many lakes in my time, but I think I have been spoiled by this lake. It was probably one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. We walked halfway up the lake before turning around. Unfortunately, we were only there for two hours because our bus back was leaving, and if we missed that, we would have had to walk back. The last lake, Lake Louise, was beautiful but not as beautiful as Moraine Lake, and we arrived at it very late. After we had been to all the lakes, we drove off to Banff.

        We arrived in Banff very late and had to go to bed immediately. Unfortunately, I felt a bit ill while we were there, but I still managed to explore the city and get some food before returning to the apartment. Later that day, we went out for dinner but couldn’t find anywhere to eat. With me being sick and everyone else a bit hangry, dinner wasn’t as good. On the second day, we left for Calgary, but before making it out of Banff, we stopped by the Upper Hot Springs. The hot springs were very relaxing before the drive to Calgary.</p>

        When we arrived in Calgary, we went out for dinner at a place where we could watch the football match between Argentina and Canada in the semifinals. After dinner, we walked down Bow River and then went home. The apartment we stayed at gave us access to a gym, which my brother and I used before going to bed. On our first day in Calgary, we went to the Calgary Stampede. We first walked around outside and checked out a lot of the exhibits there. There was everything from military vehicles to teepees, but it eventually got way too hot. We went into the big market inside to look around. I eventually found something I liked—a bamboo sword from a show I watch. There were a lot of shows happening there; we went to the Tie-Down Roping show, which was very fun to watch, but we had to leave halfway through the show because we had tickets to the rodeo. The rodeo was very overwhelming; there was a lot going on at every moment. It didn’t help that there was a kid behind us screaming all the time. Other than that, it was okay. I personally would not go to watch it again, but it was still worth seeing at least once. We left halfway through because it was just too much. The next day, we visited my mom and dad’s old college. There wasn’t much to do there, but surprisingly, there were a lot of people there even though it was during a break. What was also surprising was that we could just walk around the school and campus even though we don’t go there. After we had explored the campus, we headed back to our apartment and chilled there for the rest of the day. The next day, we headed to the airport to fly to Vancouver. Unfortunately for my dad, he had to drive the car all the way, which was around an 11-hour drive.      </p>

      When our flight landed, we had to travel to our new house by public transport, which was a bit difficult because everything was so different from how it works at home. Luckily, after a bit of confusion and jumping off at the wrong bus stop, we made it. The house was nice and out of the city, but that meant we couldn’t do anything before my dad arrived. When my dad finally arrived, it was already late, so we just went out to a restaurant two minutes away. After we had eaten, we went for a walk down the beach before heading back home. On the first day, we went to Lynn Canyon, which was a small hike to a small lagoon. After that, we went for a bit of a harder hike. We went to Grouse Mountain, which was a very hard hike. To be fair, I did have some sore muscles after I had trained, so that might have impacted my experience. Even if it was a hard climb, it was worth it. At the top, the view was incredible; you could see all of Vancouver. They had some other stuff up there too, like a small show showing how lumberjacks used to get their wood. They also had engaged bears, which was a bit scary to see but also so cool. We took a cable car down to the bottom. After that hike, we were all tired, so we just went home. The next day, we went to visit an old friend of my dad’s. He lived with his family a bit outside of Vancouver. It’s weird that people in Canada and the USA are so easy to talk to, and they are very talkative, but I kind of like that. We spent a few hours at his house driving down to a pier with a few shops around that area. After we got ice cream, we drove back home, and at that point, it was very late. On our last day, we went to Stanley Park to cycle around it. Unfortunately for me, when we took a short break, I was going to play catch with my brother but accidentally stepped on a sharp rock. I cut my foot, making it a bit hard to cycle, but I managed to keep going. After cycling around the park, we drove back home to pack. On our last day, we drove back to Seattle to deliver our car to the airport. I had a bit of trouble with the bamboo sword I bought, but it went through security fine. After that, it was smooth sailing home.      </p>
